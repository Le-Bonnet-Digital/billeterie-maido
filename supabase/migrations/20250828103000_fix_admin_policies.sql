/*
  # Unify Admin RLS Policies via users table

  Context:
  - Some previous migrations used `auth.role()` or `auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin'`
    which is brittle unless custom JWT claims are set.
  - We standardize all admin write permissions to check the `public.users` table
    with the current `auth.uid()` and role = 'admin'.

  Changes:
  - Drop and recreate "Admins can manage â€¦" policies on key tables using a
    consistent EXISTS pattern with WITH CHECK mirrors.
